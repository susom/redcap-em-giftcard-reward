 *  When Gift Card configurations use Cron processing, the Cron job must call each project through an API because the processing needs to be done
 *  in project context.
 *
 *  Now that we are in Project context, retrieve the list of configurations and check for the Enable Cron checkbox.  When Cron is enabled, first
 *  check to make sure the configuration is valid. This only needs to be done once since it is the same configuration for each record. Then, retrieve
 *  the list of records who have not rewarded a gift card yet (gift card library record id is blank).
 *
 *  Loop over each record and evaluation the logic to determine if the record is eligible for a gift card. If so, send out the reward.
